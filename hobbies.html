        <h1>What are my hobbies?
        </h1>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy hands-on projects, from building drywall structures to crafting custom furniture for my home. Music is another passion; I play guitar, sing, and produce music. I'm part of a band called Three Way Call, where we create music inspired by the style of Daft Punk. Iâ€™m also committed to continuous learning and am currently studying software engineering, aiming to enhance my technical skills and stay at the forefront of the industry.</p>
